## Overview
The key performance indicators (KPIs) for the DevOps team aim to make data more visible regarding development tasks. These measurements will help us better understand how successful we are as a department. The primary categories of what we want to measure as are follows:

- [Content Development](#content-development)
- [Bug Remediation and Prevalence](#bug-remediation-and-prevalence)
- [Request Backlog](#request-backlog)
- [Time Commitments](#time-commitments)
- [Standards Adherence](#standards-adherence)

This document is meant to describe these categories in more detail and the individual KPIs that are associated with them.

## Content Development
One of our core responsibilities on the DevOps team is to respond to and complete development requests. The number of these requests that we complete is a good indication of how we are performing our duties.

However, whenever possible, we should be looking past a request that we receive to a bigger picture of how to serve all our clients with our work. While this is not always (or even often) the case, a DevOps team member ought to be on the lookout for how to make something better than expected, while still adhering to the other development standards in this repo.

The way that we aim to measure these descriptions is by the following metrics:

> 🚧 These metrics are based on loose data of DevOps performance over a 6 month period and will likely change.


|                                KPI                                | Time frame | Goal  |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------: | :---: |
| [Development Requests Completed](#development-requests-completed) |  Monthly   |   7   |
|              [Content Developed](#content-developed)              |  Monthly   |   4   |
|        [Stack Content Developed](#stack-content-developed)        |  Monthly   |   2   |
|     [Agnostic Content Developed](#agnostic-content-developed)     |  Monthly   |   1   |

### Development Requests Completed
This is the number of development requests that a DevOps team member has completed over a set period of time.

> ❗ This metric is not limited to if the request resulted in a new piece of content, an update to content, or a bug fix. If a question was answered, or a piece of documentation was updated, that request will be included as a "completion".

> 🚧 This metric is based on loose data of DevOps performance over a 6 month period and will likely change.
```
Time frame measured: Monthly
Goal: 7
```

### Content Developed
This is the number of creations or updates made by a DevOps team member that were approved by Quality Assurance.

> ↩️ This metric does not include bug fixes. This is measured under the [Bug Remediation and Prevalence](#bug-remediation-and-prevalence) section.

> 🚧 This metric is based on loose data of DevOps performance over a 6 month period and will likely change.
```
Time frame measured: Monthly
Goal: 4
```

### Stack Content Developed
The number of additions to the stack (via creation or modification) made by a DevOps team member that were approved by Quality Assurance.

> ↩️ This metric does not include bug fixes. This is measured under the [Bug Remediation and Prevalence](#bug-remediation-and-prevalence) section.

> 🚧 This metric is based on loose data of DevOps performance over a 6 month period and will likely change.
```
Time frame measured: Monthly
Goal: 2
```

### Agnostic Content Developed
The number of agnostic additions to the stack (via creation or modification) made by a DevOps team member that were approved by Quality Assurance.

> ↩️ This metric does not include bug fixes. This is measured under the [Bug Remediation and Prevalence](#bug-remediation-and-prevalence) section.

> 🚧 This metric is based on loose data of DevOps performance over a 6 month period and will likely change.

Time frame measured: Monthly
Goal: 1

## Bug Remediation and Prevalence
When we write code, attention to detail and foresight is very important. Stopping to think about what *could* happen is an important part of the development process, and squashes many bugs before they hit production systems. Working with the requestor to make sure our content is working as intended is another important step to prevent bugs at a larger scale.

That being said, no one is perfect, and we don't expect zero mistakes to be made. However, we want to limit them as much as possible and look for areas of improvement when a team member's code has bugs that could have been caught pre-deployment. These metrics are intended to encourage mindfulness when writing our content.

|                 KPI                 | Time frame | Goal  |
| :---------------------------------: | :--------: | :---: |
|  [Bug Prevalence](#bug-prevalence)  |  Monthly   |  < 3  |
| [Bugs Remediated](#bugs-remediated) |  Monthly   |   2   |

### Bug Prevalence
The number of bug reports received on content developed by a DevOps team member.
> 🚧 This metric is based on anecdotal data and may change.
```
Time frame measured: Monthly
Goal: < 3
```

### Bugs Remediated
The number of bug reports resolved by a DevOps team member.
> 🚧 This metric is based on anecdotal data and may change.

Time frame measured: Monthly
Goal: 2
