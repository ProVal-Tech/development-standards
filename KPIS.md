## Overview
The key performance indicators (KPIs) for the DevOps team aim to measure how successful we are as a department. The primary categories of what we want to measure as are follows:

- [Time Commitments](#time-commitments)
- [Standards Adherence](#standards-adherence)

This document is meant to describe these categories in more detail and the individual KPIs that are associated with them.

### At a Glance
|                   KPI                   | Time frame | Goal  |
| :-------------------------------------: | :--------: | :---: |
| [Total Time Logged](#total-time-logged) |   Weekly   |  32   |
|       [Audit Score](#audit-score)       |  Monthly   |  40   |

## Time Commitments
At ProVal, we are expected to track what we do throughout the day. This is not only to make sure we are doing our jobs, but also is an excellent way of going back through a trail of notes to determine what happened on a particular issue.

That being said, we want to allow for a flexible schedule and prevent burnout, so setting a reasonable number for weekly hours worked is important as well.

|                   KPI                   | Time frame | Goal  |
| :-------------------------------------: | :--------: | :---: |
| [Total Time Logged](#total-time-logged) |   Weekly   |  32   |

### Total Time Logged
The number of hours logged in the ProVal PSA over a set time period.

> ‚ùì Does this mean that I can leave early every day if I log 6 1/2 hours?
> 
> üí° If you have something important that you need to get done in your personal life, then you are absolutely okay to leave early as long as you let your manager know beforehand and ideally block your calendar. However, we still expect you to be present in general even if you've hit your daily/weekly time logging KPI. Work above and beyond your baseline commitments is always appreciated, but not expected. You can browse the web, read a book, or work on something else for ProVal that you'd like to catch up on.

> If you ever need/want something to work on, let your manager know!

## Standards Adherence
The quality of our code is paramount to our success as a team. The less bugs, questions, and unforeseen consequences the better. Not only that, but the better written our code is, the better our fellow engineers can read and understand it. We should make it a point to be thorough, succinct, targeted, and professional when developing content. The standards in this repo are what define these "standards" for ProVal, and our KPIs around them.

Every week, the DevOps manager will randomly select 1-2 pieces of content to review and grade based on a weighted rubric. This rubric will directly reference standards in this repo as its source of truth.

> ‚Ü©Ô∏è The template for this rubric will be available to view [in this repo](STANDARDS_RUBRIC.md).

|             KPI             | Time frame | Goal  |
| :-------------------------: | :--------: | :---: |
| [Audit Score](#audit-score) |  Monthly   |  40   |

### Audit Score
The average weighted score for all audits over a set time period.

> ‚öîÔ∏è This KPI will likely be discussed in the future after some further data is taken in. This is a new process that we need to get dialed in.

> ‚ùó For the first few months of following the standards, an engineer will not be evaluated too harshly as they learn to adapt to the ProVal code standards.
